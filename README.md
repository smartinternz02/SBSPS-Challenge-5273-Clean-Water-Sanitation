# SBSPS-Challenge-5273-Clean-Water-Sanitation

Water is the natural resource that is most threatened by climate change, and more than half of the world does not have access to safe sanitation services.

Clean Water sanitation is the major issues faced by many countries. Let's talk about this siutaion in INDIA.
A large amount of water which looks “clean” but is ridden with harmful impurities such as arsenic or is overly saline and thus rendered undrinkable by health standards. 
This problem is particularly more intense in rural India where people cannot afford to purify water at such a large scale or install high end water purifiers in their homes. 
The totally shows the impact on their health, We have to take concern on this situation. 

WATER is most essential for every human being.

In this project we are going to see how Gov. take many steps in this situation.
In which ways water is being used in different states, which water is safe for drinking with the minreals in it.

# How we use Tech. in it

Technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption. In this project i am going to use IBM different services to complete this project like: IBM Congo, different services of IBM cloud which includes IBM stdio, watson ass. 

# The architecture

- The user accesses a Dashboard how different states use water.
- The dashboard also shows how Gov. plans their projects and their funds for these projects.
- A chat bot is here to help to the user to check hweter he is drinking safe water or not.
- A machine learning module uses the data sources as a corpus to build a recommendation model and hosts that model.
